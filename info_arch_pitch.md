Please prepare a presentation (10 minutes in total) to:
- explain your background and why you are a suitable candidate for the position (5 minutes).
- present a first brief concept idea for your PhD/PostDoc research in one of the two areas (5 minutes).
- please explicitly focus on possibilities to link your research to specific questions in urban planning or design.


What we are looking for are PhD candidates for the following two areas:
- Cognitive Urban Design Computing (in our context this is currently related to computational planning synthesis http://www.ia.arch.ethz.ch/cps/ 
- Crowdsourcing and Citizen Design Science (for urban design applications)

Your time slot for the presentation / interview is: Thursday 4 June 2105, 11:30 – 12:00. Participants from our side are Prof. Gerhard Schmitt, Dr. Reinhard König (Chair of Information Architecture ETH Zurich), Dr. Bernhard Klein (Future Cities Laboratory Singapore) and approx. four team members from our research team in Zurich. 




Present my research

My goal here is to show the perspective my research has given me on the research problems that iA faces.

My Master's research was based on the Hawkes process, or int eh terminology of Sornette's group, the "endo-exo model".

I'm gogint to talk about this, not because the details of this particular model solves every problem face by this group, but because I think it's suggestive of the perspective I bring and some intersting reseach directions.



Arbitrary fields: We can do this on graphs, on euclidean space or wahtever dimension, or upon a braod variety of otehr spaces.

Allows us to extrxt features from real-world data.


Real design problems, the Sciences of the Aritifical, are more complicated than inferring such a minimal model, and real structures are more than points.
However, we are still free to exploit structure in sub problems.
(c.f. Koenig & Schneider 2012)
So far I ahve found no extant uss of this subproblem int he literature.
