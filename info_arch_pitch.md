Please prepare a presentation (10 minutes in total) to:
- explain your background and why you are a suitable candidate for the position (5 minutes).
- present a first brief concept idea for your PhD/PostDoc research in one of the two areas (5 minutes).
- please explicitly focus on possibilities to link your research to specific questions in urban planning or design.


What we are looking for are PhD candidates for the following two areas:
- Cognitive Urban Design Computing (in our context this is currently related to computational planning synthesis http://www.ia.arch.ethz.ch/cps/ 
- Crowdsourcing and Citizen Design Science (for urban design applications)

Your time slot for the presentation / interview is: Thursday 4 June 2105, 11:30 – 12:00. Participants from our side are Prof. Gerhard Schmitt, Dr. Reinhard König (Chair of Information Architecture ETH Zurich), Dr. Bernhard Klein (Future Cities Laboratory Singapore) and approx. four team members from our research team in Zurich. 


## Employment

* Research
* Music

  Mostly in Indonesia, where I will in fact be working once again over summer this year.
  
* Software development

  * Notably for online visualization of geographic data for the AboutNSW project
  * and for broader interaction design projects such as the Dubtable.

Present my research

My goal here is to show the perspective my research has given me on the research problems that iA faces.

My Master's research was based on the Hawkes process, or int eh terminology of Sornette's group, the "endo-exo model".

I'm gogint to talk about this, not because the details of this particular model solves every problem face by this group, but because I think it's suggestive of the perspective I bring and some intersting reseach directions.

Self-exciting point processes intro

Traditional uses:
Represent a way to understand social elements of physical systems.
(Crime, terrorism, social media impact, disease)
Is a phenomena exogenously or endogenously induced?



Majro result: That in social media one can separate background influence and social contagion, and moreover that one must.

Connection to crowd sourcing research.

Represent a restricted calss of model with "nice" fowrd and inverse properties.
These represent aa very intersting case of stochastic design grammars with unknown parameters.
Relationship to procedural design projects of this group.
Cluster representation, relationship to design grammar, random fractal;
In exchange for reducing the generality we get better (faster, provable) inference performance;

Simulating "more like this", for the point process is very easy.
Since we have a defined near-convex loss function, continuous in the parameters, we can use convex optimisation methods to automatically improve apprximate fits.
reduce evolution fatigue.
Indirect inferenc methods.

Intersting "middle way" in model-based generative design problems.

Arbitrary fields: We can do this on graphs, on euclidean space or wahtever dimension, or upon a braod variety of otehr spaces.

Evolutionary models: Powerful, general, but slow and computationally expensive to fit and use. Transparent.
Generative neural networks: Powerful, general, slow to train, fast to execute, but opaque.
Random field models: Less powerful, but fast to train and to execute. Transparent.

Allows us to extrxt features from real-world data.


Real design problems, the Sciences of the Aritifical, are more complicated than inferring such a minimal model, and real structures are more than points.
However, we are still free to exploit structure in sub problems.
(c.f. Koenig & Schneider 2012)
So far I ahve found no extant uss of this subproblem int he literature.
